compareDistanceAndroid
======================

This is a simple application for Android that compares the distance between the user's current location and 
a user entered location. This user entered location can be a city name, zip code or whatever. This was made 
as a learning exercise to test the following concepts. 

Getting the user's current location. 
Getting location data from information entered into the interface. 
Retrieving distance between those two points.
